RULES OF CHECKERS:
------------------
-Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 x's or o's. (Typically, one set of pieces is black and the other red.)
-The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 playable squares (dashes) and 32 unplayable squares (blanks). It is positioned so that each player has a playable square on the right side corner closest to him or her.
-Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 playable squares closest to him or her.
-x moves first. Players then alternate moves.
-Moves are allowed only on the playable squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).
-A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.
-A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
-When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
-If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.
-When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king, represented by a capital X or O.
-Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)
-Kings may combine jumps in several directions -- forward and backward -- on the same turn. Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).
-A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. In most cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
